# async memoize

This is a learning project. I wanted to make a sort of logic equivalent to 'memoization', based in an asynchronous environment. I use an AWS lambda and DynamoDB for persistence.

If you have an AWS account, an IAM user setup along with AWS credentials on your machine, you can deploy the application to a lambda using the serverless framework: `sls deploy`.
